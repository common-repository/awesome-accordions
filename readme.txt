Easily add the accordion to any post by using the generated shortcode. 
We use [awesome-accordions id=’1234′] that will be safe to use without any conflicts

**Semantic HTML**

The accordion has a semantic HTML structure and is compatible with all modern browsers.

Do you want to have one panel open at a time or the option to keep all panels open. You can set this easily for each accordion with the toggle/collapse option.
